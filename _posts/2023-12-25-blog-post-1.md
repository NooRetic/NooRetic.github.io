Welcome post

Robotics & Machine vision project
======

Currently, I am working on a robotics machine vision project that focuses on automating cumbersome inspection tasks for robotic systems. The topics explored are:
- Robotics
- Machine vision
- Machine learning
- Robotic simulations
- Finite element analysis
- Robotic communications
- Microcontrollers
