First application	

Robotics & Machine vision project
======

This is the first part of the PhD complected. It comprises a robotic inspection system capable of inspecting holes on a block placed anywhere within its reach. The system is accurate up to +/- 0.5 degrees. The system comprises of an ABB CRB15000 GoFa robot with a DFKCU02 industrial camera and light systems.
The system utilises a finite state machine programmed in python.The system was simulated in RoboDk and test on an aluminium block with known tilts.
